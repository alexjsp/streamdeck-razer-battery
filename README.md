# macOS Razer Battery Plugin for Stream Deck 

This is a simple Stream Deck plugin that displays the battery status of a Razer mouse device on macOS.

The plugin is based on the [CPU Plugin from Elgato](https://github.com/elgatosf/streamdeck-cpu), and uses [librazermacos](https://github.com/alexjsp/librazermacos) to read the battery status from the mouse.

## Installation

I'll try and add release builds you can just download, once I figure out how to do that.

## Source code

The Sources folder contains the source code of the plugin.
